# Contactless-doorbell

Our project is based on creating a touchless doorbell,    which in the time of the  covid pandemic is very necessary, it utilizes the Arduino UNO,Relay module  and many more components to be assembled.
Whenever a person arrives at our home, so instead of pressing the bell, the person can raise hand at around 10cm so that the ultrasonic sensor can sense the presence of a person and speaker will ring automatically without any touch to the bell.
PROBLEM DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVE
During this covid situation, we are taking a lot of precautions to save ourselves from coronavirus, but there are high chances of carelessness which might lead to bad consequences .Also, due to the new variant omicron the situations are getting worse.

So, we planned on making this contactless doorbell. The main objective behind this project is to reduce the further spread of the corona virus, as when someone enters our home the first thing that he/she encounters is the doorbell, and it's not always possible to sanitise everything around us.
So, we decided to transform our traditional bell into a contactless bell, which eliminates the contact and hence reduces the chances of further spread
